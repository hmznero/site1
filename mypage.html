            <div class="c2">
                <p>Guts was born from the corpse of his dead mother, hanging lifeless from a tree,
                     and was discovered by mercenaries. He was raised by a brutal mercenary named Gambino, who treated him harshly.
                    Guts childhood was defined by suffering. He was trained as a swordsman from 
                    a young age and endured trauma,<br> including abuse and abandonment.
                    After killing Gambino in self-defense, Guts became a wandering mercenary,
                     battling to survive in a cruel world.</p>

                <p>Guts grew close to the members of the Band of the Hawk, especially Griffith and Casca. 
                    He admired Griffiths ambition to rule <br>his own kingdom and fought loyally under him.
                    Over time, Guts began to question his role as Griffith subordinate. He wanted to forge his own path and be Griffiths equal,
                     not just a tool in his dream.</p>
                <p>Griffith was born in poverty but possessed an extraordinary charisma and ambition
                    . He dreamed of building his own kingdom where he would rule
                     as king.


                    To achieve his dream, Griffith founded the Band of the Hawk, a 
                    group of mercenaries who quick<br>ly rose to prominence due to Griffith’s leadership and tactical genius.</p>
                <p>Griffith saw Guts as someone special—his “right hand” and 
                    the key to his success. Their bond became central to Griffith’s plans, and he believed Guts belonged to him.
                    Griffith’s obsession with hi<br>s dream and Guts' departure shook him
                     to his core. Losing Guts made Griffith feel b
                     etrayed and vulnerable.</p>
